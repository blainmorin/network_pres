* Interested in a descriptive historical of the capacity of environmental agencies.

* *Capacity*: The resources and professionalization required to accomplish tasks and goals. 

* Maybe we can use network analysis to observe "brain drain"

* *Brain Drain*: Highly skilled workers leaving one agency for others

This project is sort of an offshoot of one that I'm working on with Professor Rea at Glenn where I'm doing sort of an analysis of capacity of federal agencies as a latent variable. By capacity, we are talking about an agency's ability to take actions that further their mission. The thought is that agencies with things like more employees, higher wages, longer lengths of service etc. will be more able to accomplish things. One possibly related phenomenon is the notion of brain drain where highly skilled workers may get pulled away from certain agencies during certain periods of time.

# Data

* Come from a Buzzfeed News Freedom of Information Act (FOAI) request
   * Four Decades of payroll data from The U.S. Office of Personnel Management
   * From 1973 to 2013, the data are uniquely identified. This allows us to track their migrations into, out of, and through federal agencies.

It's kind of weird but the data come from Buzzfeed News who obtained it through a FOAI request. They released it publicly in 2017. It contains four decades worth of payroll data from the US Office of Personnel Management and is about 30gigs in size. The first thirty years have unique identifiers, so it's possible to track employees flowing in and out and between agencies. If we look just at the EPA.

# EPA Example

```{r, fig.width=10}

test = fed %>%
  filter(AGYSUB_next != "EXIT")

test = test %>%
  filter(AGYSUB == "EP00" | AGYSUB_next == "EP00")

test2 = test %>%
  group_by(yr) %>%
  summarize(Sent = sum(AGYSUB == "EP00"), Received = sum(AGYSUB_next == "EP00"))

test2 = test2 %>%
  gather(key = Measure, value = Edge, 2:3)


p = test2 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = yr, y = Edge)) +
  geom_line(aes(group = Measure, color = Measure), size = 1.5) +
  ylab("Number of Employees") +
  xlab("Year") +
  theme_bw() +
  scale_color_brewer(type = "qual", palette = 2) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1973, seq(1976, 2010, by = 4,), 2012), minor_breaks = 1973:2012) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1))
  
ggplotly(p) %>%
    config(displayModeBar = FALSE)

```

???

So here we're looking at the employees that either left another agency to work at the EPA or left the EPA to work at another agency. There's not a real clear cut pattern, but we see there is a period from around 1982 to 1994 where the EPA was receiving more employees from other agencies than it was giving up. These years, they are a sort of people absorbing sponge soaking up employees. But, we don;t know from this graph what types of employees are moving in and out. In terms of scale, the EPA averaged around 11,000 employees during this period. So, 100 employees is like 9%.

So here's a familiar looking thing.

# Hello World

Install the **xaringan** package from [Github](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan):

```{r eval=FALSE, tidy=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("yihui/xaringan")
```

--

You are recommended to use the [RStudio IDE](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/), but you do not have to.

- Create a new R Markdown document from the menu `File -> New File -> R Markdown -> From Template -> Ninja Presentation`;<sup>1</sup>

--

- Click the `Knit` button to compile it;

--

- or use the [RStudio Addin](https://rstudio.github.io/rstudioaddins/)<sup>2</sup> "Infinite Moon Reader" to live preview the slides (every time you update and save the Rmd document, the slides will be automatically reloaded in RStudio Viewer.

# Hello Ninja

As a presentation ninja, you certainly should not be satisfied by the "Hello World" example. You need to understand more about two things:

1. The [remark.js](https://remarkjs.com) library;

1. The **xaringan** package;

Basically **xaringan** injected the chakra of R Markdown (minus Pandoc) into **remark.js**. The slides are rendered by remark.js in the web browser, and the Markdown source needed by remark.js is generated from R Markdown (**knitr**).

---

# remark.js

You can see an introduction of remark.js from [its homepage](https://remarkjs.com). You should read the [remark.js Wiki](https://github.com/gnab/remark/wiki) at least once to know how to

- create a new slide (Markdown syntax<sup>*</sup> and slide properties);

- format a slide (e.g. text alignment);

- configure the slideshow;

- and use the presentation (keyboard shortcuts).

It is important to be familiar with remark.js before you can understand the options in **xaringan**.

.footnote[[*] It is different with Pandoc's Markdown! It is limited but should be enough for presentation purposes. Come on... You do not need a slide for the Table of Contents! Well, the Markdown support in remark.js [may be improved](https://github.com/gnab/remark/issues/142) in the future.]

# Using xaringan

---

# xaringan

Provides an R Markdown output format `xaringan::moon_reader` as a wrapper for remark.js, and you can use it in the YAML metadata, e.g.

```yaml
---
title: "A Cool Presentation"
output:
  xaringan::moon_reader:
    yolo: true
    nature:
      autoplay: 30000
---
```

See the help page `?xaringan::moon_reader` for all possible options that you can use.

# remark.js vs xaringan

Some differences between using remark.js (left) and using **xaringan** (right):

.pull-left[
1. Start with a boilerplate HTML file;

1. Plain Markdown;

1. Write JavaScript to autoplay slides;

1. Manually configure MathJax;

1. Highlight code with `*`;

1. Edit Markdown source and refresh browser to see updated slides;
]

.pull-right[
1. Start with an R Markdown document;

1. R Markdown (can embed R/other code chunks);

1. Provide an option `autoplay`;

1. MathJax just works;<sup>*</sup>

1. Highlight code with `{{}}`;

1. The RStudio addin "Infinite Moon Reader" automatically refreshes slides on changes;
]

.footnote[[*] Not really. See next page.]

# Math Expressions

You can write LaTeX math expressions inside a pair of dollar signs, e.g. &#36;\alpha+\beta$ renders $\alpha+\beta$. You can use the display style with double dollar signs:

```
$$\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$
```

$$\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$

Limitations:

1. The source code of a LaTeX math expression must be in one line, unless it is inside a pair of double dollar signs, in which case the starting `$$` must appear in the very beginning of a line, followed immediately by a non-space character, and the ending `$$` must be at the end of a line, led by a non-space character;

1. There should not be spaces after the opening `$` or before the closing `$`.

1. Math does not work on the title slide (see [#61](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/issues/61) for a workaround).

# R Code

```{r comment='#'}
# a boring regression
fit = lm(dist ~ 1 + speed, data = cars)
coef(summary(fit))
dojutsu = c('地爆天星', '天照', '加具土命', '神威', '須佐能乎', '無限月読')
grep('天', dojutsu, value = TRUE)
```

---

# R Plots

```{r cars, fig.height=4, dev='svg'}
par(mar = c(4, 4, 1, .1))
plot(cars, pch = 19, col = 'darkgray', las = 1)
abline(fit, lwd = 2)
```

---

# Tables

If you want to generate a table, make sure it is in the HTML format (instead of Markdown or other formats), e.g.,

```{r}
knitr::kable(head(iris), format = 'html')
```

---

# HTML Widgets

I have not thoroughly tested HTML widgets against **xaringan**. Some may work well, and some may not. It is a little tricky.

Similarly, the Shiny mode (`runtime: shiny`) does not work. I might get these issues fixed in the future, but these are not of high priority to me. I never turn my presentation into a Shiny app. When I need to demonstrate more complicated examples, I just launch them separately. It is convenient to share slides with other people when they are plain HTML/JS applications.

See the next page for two HTML widgets.
